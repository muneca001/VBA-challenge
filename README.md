# VBA-challenge

Created a script that loops through all the stocks in a workbook to output the following:
ticker symbol, 
yearly and percentage change from the opening/closing price at the beginning and end of that year,
total volume for each stock, and
the stocks with the greatest and least percent change, as well as the greatest total volume

The percent change column was formated using VBA to include the percentage symbol.
In addition, green and red color filling was applied to indicate positive or negative values for the yearly change column

Analysis Results: LVR has been the stock with the highest percent increase for all 3 years and QKN had the largest stock volume for 2018 and 2020. 

Knowing LVR has had the highest percent increase throughout the years indicates it would most likely be the most profitable for the following year, if of course, we have the same conditions from that of previous years.
