# VBA-challenge

Created a script that loops through all the stocks in a workbook to output the following:
ticker symbol, 
yearly and percentage change from the opening/closing price at the beginning and end of that year,
total volume for each stock, and
the stocks with the greatest and least percent change, as well as the greatest total volume

The percent change column was formated using VBA to include the percentage symbol.
In addition, green and red color filling was applied to indicate positive or negative values for the yearly change column
