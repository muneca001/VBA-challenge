# VBA-challenge

Created a script that loops through all the stocks in a workbook to output the following:
ticker symbol, 
yearly and percentage change from the opening/closing price at the beginning and end of that year,
total volume for each stock, and
the stocks with the greatest and least percent change, as well as the greatest total volume

The percent change column was formated using VBA to include the percentage symbol.
In addition, green and red color filling was applied to indicate positive or negative values for the yearly change column

Analysis Results

2018:
  Greatest % Increase - THB at 141.42%
  Greatest % Drecrease - RKS at -90.02%
  Greatest Total Volume - QKN 

2019:
  Greatest % Increase - RYU at 190.03%
  Greatest % Drecrease - RKS at -91.60%
  Greatest Total Volume - ZQD
  
2020:
  Greatest % Increase - YDI at 188.76%
  Greatest % Drecrease - VNG at -89.05%
  Greatest Total Volume - QKN

What appears to be the most consitant results come from the greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume. Ticker RKS resulted with greatest percent decrease for both 2018 and 2019. The ticker with the greatest total volume in 2018 and 2020 was QKN. 

Knowing this information for the three year time period indicates we must bring other sources of data to capture the correlations between tickers which resulted in the highest and lowest percent change, in addition to the greatest total volume. This analysis may serve as the basis for using machine learning to predict 2021's results.
